Hush; may I ask you all for silence?
The dreamer is still asleep.
May the goddess keep us from single vision
And you to sleep

The dreamer is still asleep
The dreamer is still asleep
He's inventing landscapes in their magnetic field.
Working out a means of escape
We'll cut across the crop circles

The seer says no.
Not much time left for these escape attempts.
Look at it this way
In ten years' time
Who'll care? Who'll even remember?
One dies like that, deep within it,
Almost inside it
It's there for a reason.
